# Containers and DevOps - Developer edition hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the end of this lab you will be better able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.

## Overview

Fabrikam Medical Conferences (FabMedical) provides conference website services tailored to the medical community. They are refactoring their application code, based on node.js, so that it can run as a Docker application, and want to implement a POC that will help them get familiar with the development process, lifecycle of deployment, and critical aspects of the hosting environment. They will be deploying their applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and want to learn how to deploy containers in a dynamically load-balanced manner, discover containers, and scale them on demand.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing this POC with a subset of the application code base. You will create a build agent based on Linux, and an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for running deployed applications. You will be helping them to complete the Docker setup for their application, test locally, push to an image repository, deploy to the cluster, and test load-balancing and scale.

> **IMPORTANT**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft email prefix to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

The solution will use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which means that the container cluster topology is provisioned according to the number of requested nodes. The proposed containers deployed to the cluster are illustrated below with Cosmos DB as a managed service:

Each tenant will have the following containers:

- **Conference Web site**: The SPA application that will use configuration settings to handle custom styles for the tenant.

- **Admin Web site**: The SPA application that conference owners use to manage conference configuration details, manage attendee registrations, manage campaigns and communicate with attendees.

- **Registration service**: The API that handles all registration activities creating new conference registrations with the appropriate package selections and associated cost.

- **Email service**: The API that handles email notifications to conference attendees during registration, or when the conference owners choose to engage the attendees through their admin site.

- **Config service**: The API that handles conference configuration settings such as dates, locations, pricing tables, early bird specials, countdowns, and related.

- **Content service**: The API that handles content for the conference such as speakers, sessions, workshops, and sponsors.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

    - You must have rights to create a service principal as discussed in Before the Hands on Lab Task 9: Create a Service Principal --- and this typically requires a subscription owner to log in. You may have to ask another subscription owner to login to the portal and execute that step ahead of time if you do not have the rights.

    - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Before the Hands on Lab Task 5: Create a build agent VM and Task 10: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. You'll need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, or more if you choose additional agents or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

    - Command prompts:

        - On Windows, you will be using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, hereon referred to as WSL.

        - On Mac, all instructions should be executed using bash in Terminal.

3. You will be asked to install other tools throughout the exercises.

> **VERY IMPORTANT**: You should be typing all of the commands as they appear in the guide, except where explicitly stated in this document. Do not try to copy and paste to your command windows or other documents where you are instructed to enter information shown in this document. There can be issues with Copy and Paste that result in errors, execution of instructions, or creation of file content.
